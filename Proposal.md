# Project Proposal

## 1) Project Set Up - 2 pts
  1pt - Successfully creates repository and adds all group members to the repo
  1pt - Uses well formatted markdown throughout this document (headers for each section, lists where appropriate, hyperlinked words, etc.)

The link below is the dataset that I will be using to complete my final project.
[US Police Shootings Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings/data)

## 2) Abstract, Keywords, Introduction - 8 pts
  Clearly describes final project, significance, and articulates 3-5 research questions. Also includes abstract and keywords:

The significance of this project is that it can paint a clearer picture of the climate of law enforcement in the United States by analyzing that circumstances that surround a police shooting. By understanding this, we can better assess and understand police violence in the US and ultimately try to decrease/prevent it.

Research questions:
- What type of person is most likely to get shot by police officers?
- What circumstances could lead to an unarmed person getting shot by police officers?
- How does race factor into police violence?

## 3) Related Work - 6 pts
Engages with 3 relevant related works and explains how proposed project fits into this space

- [Police Shootings Database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)
This Washington Post article analyzes police shooting data from 2015-2024 and looks on causes and circumstances surrounding the incidents.
- [Police Shootings and Race](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/fryer/files/empirical_analysis_tables_figures.pdf)
Harvard paper which looks at how race influences police shootings in the US, from July 2017.
- [Race and Police Shootings](https://manhattan.institute/article/fatal-police-shootings-and-race-a-review-of-the-evidence-and-suggestions-for-future-research)
A report from the Manhattan institute, which also analyzes the correlation between race and police shootings.

## 4) Dataset - 7 pts
Clearly describes and critically analyzes dataset, including a link to data source:

This dataset features 15 independent variables (columns), with a row representing a single individual who was shot by police. In a row, you can see the individual’s name, age, and date of the shooting, as well as other parameters including signs of mental illness, whether or not they were fleeing, whether they were armed, etc (each variable is a single column). In total there are 4895 individuals listed in this dataset, with each individual having a unique ID.

## 5) Implications - 4 pts
Addresses possible implications:

From the analysis of this dataset, we can better understand what increases one’s odds of being targeted in a police shooting and seen as a threat. The conclusions of this analysis can be utilized both my police departments and regular citizens in order to properly approach police interactions and ultimately prevent police violence.

## 6) Challenges & Limitations - 3 pts
Addresses challenges & limitations:

One limitation of this dataset is that we cannot actually know how the officer-citizen interaction played out in its entirety, though we can make assumptions based on the information provided to us from the dataset (‘signs of mental illness’, ‘armed’, etc.). This leaves some speculation up to us in terms of drawing conclusions on the justification of the police action, since we only have the parameters surrounding the interaction and leave much up to interpretation/assumption.
